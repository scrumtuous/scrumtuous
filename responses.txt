Thanks so much for the follow! It looks like we're following each other.
Can I ask for some help? I'm trying hard to grow my YouTube channel but it's really hard.
Could you maybe like a video or even subscribe?
Thanks so much!

OMG! Thank you so much! Likes and views really help the YouTube algo see me. You have no idea!

Some of my first videos are cringe in camera and audio quality. 

I upgraded my camera and mic, so the quality is really going to improve over what's already up!

I'll create great content. I won't let you down!


It helps me go from being invisible on YouTube to being listed highly!

Thanks for joining the CSE Student's Society.
One favor I have to ask is for you to subscribe to my YouTube channel. It's got great content, and I could really use the help building my channel.
Thanks!
