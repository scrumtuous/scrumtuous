If you want to succeed as an agile developer, here are the five best certifications to have. Number one, certified scrum developer, a productive agile developer understands the scrum process. They understand how a can band board works. They understand the importance of the product backlog. They understand what to do in the daily stand up. And more importantly, they believe in the process. They don't have to be sold on scrum values. Number two certified cloud developer Modern software development happens in the cloud. A productive scrum developer needs to know how to provision cloud-based resources, troubleshoot code in the cloud and overcome cloud-based security and firewall issues. An Amazon Azure or Google cloud developer cert prove these capabilities. Number three, certified Java developer, a developer needs to know how to write Coke. I like to see a Java certification on a developer's resume. Even if the target language isn't Java, a strong understanding of object oriented programming, along with the knowledge of design patterns are transferable to any 

Language. 

Number four certified DevOps engineer Agile's highest priority is the continuous delivery of software. An agile scrum developer needs to understand the DevOps tool chain that makes that happen. A DevOps engineer cert proves knowledge of GI Jenkins and other important DevOps tools. Number five, Kubernetes, and Cloudnative associate a Kubernetes certification is rare, but it's definitely a plus a developer who brings a strong knowledge of Cloudnative computing, 12 factor development and understanding of the limitations of Docker and Kubernetes will help streamline microservices development. Every scrum development team needs at least one expert on Docker and Kubernetes. Overall, these five certifications will serve you well in your career as an agile certified scrum developer.
