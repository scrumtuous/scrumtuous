After signing up for an AWS account, the first thing you need to is log into the Management console and create an administrative user for yourself, because you should never perform AWS administration with the root account.

To do this, go to the "I AM" dashboard.

Click on 'users,' and cthen lick the blue, 'add users' button.

Create a new user. I'm going to name this user 'Darcy.' 

I will also assign this user access keys, and allow them to authenticate with a username and password.

To make Darcy an Administrative user, I need to create a new group.

Create a new group called 'Administrators.'

Base the rights of this group on the existing "administrator access" policy.

Once the user is added to the group, I'll add a tag. 

I'm just going to indicate that the user 'Darcy' has platinum status. 

Click 'review' and then click 'create user.' 

You can then email this user their log-in instructions. Or you can give them this CSV file which includes their access keys and the URL they need to use in order to log in to the administrative console.

As you can see, here's the access key. Here's the secret key. And here's the special download link that has the organizations ID in it. 

Copy this link and then log out as the root user.

Then sign back in as an new IAM user with administrative rights.

You notice the, the account ID is filled in when you use the provided URL.

Type in your username and password.

When you've signed in successfully, you can start to use the various AWS services.

Never perform administrative functions with the root account. Perform all day-to-day management functions with an administrative account instead.
