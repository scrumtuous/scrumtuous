Agile vs DevOps

The key difference between Agile versus DevOps is that Agile is a philosophy about how software should be developed, while DevOps describes how to effectively use a modern software tools to continuously deploy software collaboratively.

If a software developer is Agile, they behave in a manner that is consistent with the values and principles defined in the Agile manifesto. 

Being agile means embracing the philosophy that it's better to respond to change than to following a plan, and valuing working software over comprehensive documentation. 

These are two of the values defined in the Agile manifesto. As you can see, Agile is a philosophy about how software can be developed.

In contrast, DevOps is more than just a philosophy. DevOps describes how modern tools like Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes and Git can be used by both developer and operations people to collaboratively and continuously develop and deploy software.

There is no single, widely agreed upon definition of DevOps. But most attempts to define the term include the 'culture', and what is culture? It's simply a combination of like minded people, the tools those people use, and the processes that come out of that usage. 

Now here's where it gets interesting.

How are people who embrace DevOps culture like minded? They embrace an Agile mindset. 

They believe in customer collaboration over contract negotiation. 

They believe working software is the primary mesure of of progress.

They believe that simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essentail.

All of which are ideas pulled right out of the Agile Manifesto.

And another essential part of culture is the tools people use and the processes that come out of that use.

DevOps pipelines that pull from GitHub, run on Jenkins, build microservices, deploy into Docker containers and push into the cloud are implementing a process known as the continuous delivery and deployment of software. 

And interestingly enough, the manifesto states that an Agile practitioners highest priority is the continuous delivery of software. So one of the outputs of a DevOps based digital transformation is the most higly prized artifact of the Agile philosophy.

As you can see, DevOps and Agile are not conflicting concepts. Instead, they are complimentary.

Agile is a progressive philosophy about software development that embraces change, continuous delivery and collaboration.

And DevOps is all about people using modern tools to implement collaborative processes that bring development and operations teams together.

To do DevOps right, all participants must embrace an Agile mindset. 

It is only when this happen that DevOps based digital transformations are a success.
