When and IAM user signs into the AWS console, they have to provide a difficult to remember 12 digit Account ID.

To help simplify the life of your users, create an alias for the account ID.

To do this, log in as an administrative user.

Click on the IAM dashboard.

Then create an account Alias. My account alias will be scrumtuous

Save your changes and log out. 

The next time a user logs in, rather than typing in that long, difficult to remember, 12 digit number, all they have to do is remember the alias.

And that's how you map an alias to you AWS account ID.
