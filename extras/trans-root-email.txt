Occasionally the need arises to change the email address associated with the root AWS account.

Doing so isn't as obvious as one might think.

You  first need to log in with the root account. The root email addresses is currently root@scrumtuous.com.

And once you're logged in, click on the IAM dashboard. 

Click the link for 'my security credentials' and you'll be able to configure a number of resources, including access keys, multi-factor authentication and X509 certificates. 


You'll also notice there's a link that allows you to change the email address. Click here and change the email. 

I'm going to change the email address to be admin@scrumshoeus.com.

Provide the root password and save your changes. And the new email account has been added

Log out and you'll be able to log back in with the new root email address. 

And that's how you update the root email address on your AWS account.
