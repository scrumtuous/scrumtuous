What is the cloud?
------------------

The term 'cloud' is simply a marketing term companies use to make their online products and services sound cool.

Think of all the things you can't do when the Internet goes down:

* You can't watch Netflix
* You can't post to Instagram
* You can't listen to Spotify
* You can't access GMail
* You can't play Fortnite
* You can't chat on Discord

All of these apps, features or services are either entirely cloud based, or at the very least, they require some type of network connectivity to work. You will often hear these products referred to as cloud based services:

* Netflix is a cloud-based movie streaming services
* Facebook is a cloud-based social media platform
* Spotify is a cloud-based music streaming service

With a cloud based application, most of the important logic, storage and data processing functions happen on computers and server your device connects to through the Internet. The data storage and processing does not happen locally on your phone, tablet or computer.

== The Opposite of the Cloud

Turn off your computer's Internet connection. What programs work?

* You can probably play the built in Solitaire and Minesweeper games.
* If your computer has  Microsoft Office installed, you can probably open up Word and PowerPoint.
* You can play any mp3 files you downloaded to your computer before the Internet went downloaded
* You can view any photos that you previously downloaded off your phone
* You can edit your videos using software like MovieMaker if you have it installed on your machine

None of these examples require the services of externally located computers. All of the data, software and processing power required to play a song or edit a video happens on the tablet you're holding in your hand or on the desktop located in your home.

=== On-Premise vs the Cloud

When all of your computing needs are fulfilled by a computer you own, that resided in your house, and it can run without the need to connect to a server located somewhere on the internet, it is referred to as an on-premise system.

Running software programs locally, on an on-premise computer in your home or office without the need for a network connection is the polar opposite of a cloud-based system.

== What is Cloud Computing?

What does a typical, on-premise desktop or laptop computer do?

* It stores files such as images, videos and music
* It runs programs like PhotoShop, Movie Maker or VirtualDJ Pro

Any time you use a cloud based computer to perform a function that would traditionally be done on a home computer of your own, that's considered cloud-computing.

In its simplest form, storing images, music, videos and other files in Dropbox or in Apple's iCloud can be considered cloud-computing.

When you upload your images and videos Apple's iCloud, instead of downloading them all to your local desktop, you have transferred the responsibility of storing data from your personal device to the cloud.

And when you sort your images by date, or organize your videos by filesize, all of the computer processing required to perform those tasks will be done by iCloud servers, not your phone or your desktop. Not only will your computer have more hard drive space, because all of the data is stored in the cloud, but your computer will likely perform faster because it isn't bogged down by as it tries to manage, index and organize a bloated hard drive.

When you use the cloud to do something a computer would normally do, especially in terms of file storage or data processing, that is what we call cloud-computing.


=== DJ Scrumtuous' Data Dilemma

DJ Scrumtuous is an up and coming rapper who rhymes about DevOps, Scrum and Agile virtues.

She is doing daily video podcasts, recording several new beats a day and taking lots of photographs to document her journey. Unfortunately, she has shot so much video and recorded so many beats, she has no more storage space on her laptop.

DJ Scrumtuous needs 2TB of storage space right now. She also predicts that in six months to a year she will need about 30TB of storage.

She priced out a network storage device (NAS) on Canada Computers and found the cheapest one was $459.

For 30 TB of data, she would need two 16 TB hard drives which are $599 each.

To guard against losing all of her work from a single hard drive failure, she would need an additional two hard drives to 'mirror' the primary hard drives.

DevOps rap is a cutthroat game, so there is a good chance someone will try to steal the hard drives with all of her beats on them. So DJ Scrumtuous also wants to maintain an offsite copy of her data at her Mom's place just in case her apartment gets robbed. So in total, she'd need six 16 TB hard drives.

Oh, and there's one other problem, DJ Scrumtuous knows all about the Thug Life, but she knows nothing about the Nerd Life. She has no idea how to set up a NAS system, so she'd have to hire someone technical to set the whole thing up for her.

=== Amazon S3 Storage

Alternatively, DJ Scrumtuous has learned that 2TB of object storage on Amazon S3 is $47 a month, it's pay-as-you go, and she can increase her storage capacity way beyond 30TB if the need arises.

Furthermore, all S3 data is failover protected, there is 99.95% up-time promise and eleven nines of durability, which means none of her files will ever be lost.

Furthermore, S3 is a fully managed system, so DJ Scrumtuous doesn't have to install anything, manage any software or perform any future upgrades or updates.

Which option do you think DJ Scrumtuous should chose? The $4,321 on-premise solution, or the pay-as-you-go solution that takes advantage of cloud computing

How is over-provisioning or under-provisioning a danger with the on-premise option?


=== DJ Scrumtuous' Processing Problem

Every night DJ Scrumtuous processes the raw, 4K video she shoots on her daily, long-form podcast. However, her laptop simply isn't powerful enough.

It usually takes 4 hours to process one hour of video on her laptop, so a 3 hour video has to process overnight. Furthermore, sometimes her laptop runs out of memory and when she wakes up in the morning, the process has failed to complete.

Other times she has three separate video files that need to process. That means she sometimes has to get up in the middle of the night to start a second or third file to process in order to make her videos available to her fans the next day.

To reduce the processing time and eliminate system crashes, DJ Scrumtuous has priced out a system with 64 gigs of memory and an i9-11900K processor for $6,099 plus tax. The up and coming DJ doesn't have that much money on hand, but has been offered financing with a 22% interest rate. Here monthly payments will be $270 for 3 years.

Optionally, DJ Scrumtuous have found out that she can install her video editing software on a virtual Windows machine that runs on Amazon's Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) service.

The EC2 cloud service allows the video processing to run on extremely powerful servers that will compress an hour of video in about 45 minutes. Furthermore, if there are multiple videos to process, three separate virtual machines can be run in parallel, allowing all three files to be processed at the same time - something that wouldn't be possible on the on-premise machine she is thinking of purchasing.

Each hour of processing time would cost about $3 on EC2.

Which option do you think would be the best for DJ Scrumtuous, the $6,099 on-premise solution, or the solution that takes advantage of virtual machines and cloud computing?




=== A Perspective on Data Sizes

Here's a comparison of the different data size categorizations from a bit, right up to a terrabyte.

* A bit is a piece of data that can be represented by a 1 or a 0.

* A byte is 8 bits of data. Each letter in a text file is a byte of data.

* A kilobyte (KB) is 1000 bytes of data. That's like a text file with 250 words in it.

* A megabyte (MB) is 1000 kilobytes. A 1 minute mp3 is about a mega-byte in size.

* 1000 megabytes, or about 17 hours of mp3 music, is a giga-byte (GB)

* 1000 gigabytes, or about 2 years of mp3 music, is a terra-byte (TB)

* A 4K movie shot in the uncompressed format Hollywood studios use consumes 18.2GB per minute, or just over a single TB per hour.

# 1000 terabytes is a petabyte.
